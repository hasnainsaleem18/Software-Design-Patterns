# Software Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the Software Design Patterns repository! This repository showcases Java implementations of fundamental design patterns including Builder, Singleton, MVC, and Factory patterns.

## Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. Builder Pattern

#### Builder Pattern Example

- **Builder interface:** Defines methods for building complex objects step by step.
- **Concrete Builders:** Implement the `Builder` interface to construct specific types of objects.
- **Director class:** Coordinates the building process using a `Builder` object.

### 2. Singleton Pattern

#### Singleton Pattern Example

- **Singleton class:** Ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the program.
- **Static instance:** Provides a global point of access to the singleton instance.
- **Lazy initialization:** Demonstrates both eager and lazy initialization approaches.

### 3. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern

#### MVC Pattern Example

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic.
- **View:** Presents the data to the user.
- **Controller:** Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.
- **Example application:** Demonstrates how MVC separates concerns in a GUI application using Swing.

### 4. Factory Pattern

#### Factory Pattern Example

- **Factory interface:** Declares a method for creating objects.
- **Concrete factories:** Implement the `Factory` interface to produce specific types of objects.
- **Client class:** Uses the factory to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
